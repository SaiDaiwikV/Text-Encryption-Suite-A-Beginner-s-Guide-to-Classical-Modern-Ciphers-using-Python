# Text-Encryption-Suite: A Beginner's Guide to Classical & Modern Ciphers using Python

## Project Description

This project is a **beginner-friendly cybersecurity tool** that allows you to **encrypt text using 10+ popular encryption algorithms** ranging from classical ciphers like Caesar and Atbash to modern techniques like AES, RSA, and Fernet.  

It's an ideal stepping stone for anyone learning **encryption basics**, **Python**, or looking to kickstart their journey in **cybersecurity** and **information security** domains.

### Features
